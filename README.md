### What is it?
Couch Potato Portfolio Calculator is a webapp that helps DIY passive investors make calculations that help them manage their portfolio.
- The `BUY` calculator computes how much of each security an investor should buy based on their desired portfolio allocation, when they want to increase the value of their portfolio (good for DCA use cases).
- The `REBALANCE` calculator computes how much of each security an investor should buy or sell in order to achieve their desired portfolio allocation. The rebalance calculator is used to rebalance a portfolio, if no new funds are being added.
